# Web Development Project 4 - _Discover cats_

Submitted by: **Francis Eyanae**

This web app: **Have you ever wanted to discover more about a subject, but didn't know where to begin? Well, this is the project for you! This week, you will create a web app similar to the now-defunct StumbleUpon, which allows users to discover new things by clicking through random new stuff. The web app will display one element at a time with information through API calls in a random fashion. The user can influence what they want to see next via a ban list! For example, if the web app showed you a work of art created by Elizabeth Catlett, but you already know all of her works, then you can remove any works by her from future searches.**

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## Required Features

- [x] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [x] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [x] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**
